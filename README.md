# Goose Bot #
Discord bot for spicing up a server and provide some fun. The code is open-source but this bot is running publicly on a VPS. I rather have you invite the bot yourself instead of starting up your own instance, the code is open-source for learning purposes and open improvements.

Use the link below to invite the bot to your server!
