# Goose Bot #
Discord bot for spicing up a server and provide some fun. The code is open-source but this bot is running publicly on a VPS. I rather have you invite the bot yourself instead of starting up your own instance; this way I know if there are any issues lingering around quicker! The code is open-source for learning purposes and of course transparancy.

Use the link below to invite the bot to your server!
-- Removed for now. Send me a message to access the bot! --

Please note that this bot may not be perfect and may contain errors. If you encounter one, or you have a feature suggestion, you can use the Issues tab on Github or contact the owner of this bot on Discord at Niek#7864. Thanks!

*Additionaly, the levels functionality is under testing under a bigger scale, not anymore on a private testing server. It's disabled by default.*

### Requirements ###
* FFmpeg 
* PostgreSQL
