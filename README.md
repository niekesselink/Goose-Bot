# Goose Bot #
Discord bot for spicing up a server and provide some fun. The code is open-source but this bot is running publicly on a VPS. I rather have you invite the bot yourself instead of starting up your own instance; this way I know if there are any issues lingering around quicker! The code is open-source for learning purposes and of course transparancy.

Use the link below to invite the bot to your server!

(The bot is currently offline as the VPS it was running on is affected by the fire that happened at the OVH datacenter. More information about the status of that can be found here; http://travaux.ovh.net/?do=details&id=49484)

Please note that this bot may not be perfect and may contain errors. If you encounter one, or you have a feature suggestion, you can use the Issues tab on Github or contact the owner of this bot on Discord at Niek#8930. Thanks!
